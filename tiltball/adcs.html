    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This project demonstrates an advanced control system that balances a ball at the top of an inverted hemispherical bowl. 
      The system integrates dual-axis PID control with a dynamic 3D simulation, implemented in MATLAB. The solution highlights 
      my proficiency in control theory, numerical methods, and software engineering.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="problem-description">
    <h2>Problem Description</h2>
    <p>
      The challenge is to maintain the ball at the apex of an inverted bowl, ensuring that it never rolls off. The system must:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Accurately sense the ball’s position in both the x and y axes.</li>
      <li>Use a dual-axis PID controller to compute corrective tilt angles.</li>
      <li>Apply these corrections in real time to keep the ball balanced.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="center">

  </section>

  <section id="technical-solution">
    <h2>Technical Solution</h2>
    <p>
      The solution is implemented in MATLAB and is built around three main components:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Dual-axis PID control for calculating the necessary corrections.</li>
      <li>3D transformations to simulate the bowl's tilt.</li>
      <li>Dynamic simulation of the ball's motion using numerical integration.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>1. Dual-Axis PID Control Implementation</h3>
    <p>
      The dual-axis PID controllers compute the tilt angles <code>phi_x</code> and <code>phi_y</code> based on the ball’s deviation 
      from the center (i.e., desired position 0). The following code snippet shows the PID control calculations:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
// Calculate the error (difference from center)
err_x = x;    // x-axis error (desired value is 0)
err_y = y;    // y-axis error (desired value is 0)

// Update the integral of the error over time
err_int_x = err_int_x + err_x * dt;
err_int_y = err_int_y + err_y * dt;

// Calculate the derivative (rate of change) of the error
err_dot_x = (err_x - prev_err_x) / dt;
err_dot_y = (err_y - prev_err_y) / dt;

// Compute the PID control signals for each axis
phi_x = Kp * err_x + Ki * err_int_x + Kd * err_dot_x;
phi_y = Kp * err_y + Ki * err_int_y + Kd * err_dot_y;
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>  
      In this snippet, the error is computed as the difference between the current position and the desired (center) position.  
      The integral term accumulates the error over time to correct for any steady-state bias, while the derivative term predicts future 
      errors by measuring the rate of change. The resulting control signals, <code>phi_x</code> and <code>phi_y</code>, determine the 
      corrective tilt of the bowl.
    </p>

    <h3>2. 3D Transformation for Bowl Tilt</h3>
    <p>
      The simulation models the bowl's tilt in 3D by applying rotation matrices. The following code snippet calculates the rotation matrices 
      for tilting about the x-axis and y-axis, and then combines them:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
// Rotation about the x-axis (tilting in the y-direction)
R_x = [1,        0,           0;
       0, cos(phi_y), -sin(phi_y);
       0, sin(phi_y),  cos(phi_y)];

// Rotation about the y-axis (tilting in the x-direction)
R_y = [ cos(phi_x), 0, sin(phi_x);
       0, 1, 0;
       -sin(phi_x), 0, cos(phi_x)];

// Combined rotation matrix to apply both tilts
R_world = R_y * R_x;
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>  
      Here, two separate rotation matrices are computed: <code>R_x</code> rotates the bowl about the x-axis, and <code>R_y</code> 
      rotates it about the y-axis. Multiplying these matrices (<code>R_world = R_y * R_x</code>) combines the rotations, allowing the 
      simulation to accurately reflect the bowl's orientation in world coordinates. This transformation is critical for rendering the bowl 
      and the ball in a 3D space.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Simulation of Ball Dynamics</h3>
    <p>
      The ball's dynamics on the bowl's surface are modeled using a simplified second-order differential equation. The following snippet 
      demonstrates how the ball's acceleration is computed and how its velocity and position are updated using Euler integration:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
// Compute ball acceleration in the local coordinate system
x_ddot = (g/R) * x - g * phi_x - damping * x_dot;
y_ddot = (g/R) * y - g * phi_y - damping * y_dot;

// Update velocity (first integration)
x_dot = x_dot + x_ddot * dt;
y_dot = y_dot + y_ddot * dt;

// Update position (second integration)
x = x + x_dot * dt;
y = y + y_dot * dt;
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>  
      The acceleration of the ball along each axis is a function of its current displacement (<code>x</code> and <code>y</code>), the 
      gravitational constant (<code>g</code>), and the corrective tilt provided by the PID controllers (<code>phi_x</code> and <code>phi_y</code>).  
      The damping term helps to mitigate oscillations. Euler integration is then used to update the ball's velocity and position over time, 
      simulating its continuous motion on the bowl's surface.

  <section id="system-details">
    <h2>System Operation & Detailed Explanations</h2>
    <h3>How the System Works (in My Own Words)</h3>
    <p>
      The system is designed to keep a ball balanced at the apex of an inverted bowl using a continuous feedback loop:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Sensing:</strong>  
        High-speed sensors (such as an optical camera or an array of infrared sensors) continuously capture the ball’s position on the bowl’s surface.  
        The acquired data is processed to extract precise x and y coordinates relative to the bowl’s center.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Control:</strong>  
        A dual-axis PID controller computes the error between the ball’s current position and the center.  
        The controller processes the proportional, integral, and derivative components of the error to generate two corrective tilt angles (<code>phi_x</code> and <code>phi_y</code>), which drive the error toward zero.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Actuation:</strong>  
        The computed control signals are transmitted to high-precision servo motors, which adjust the tilt of the bowl in real time.  
        This adjustment creates a restoring gravitational force that nudges the ball back to the center.
      </li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Sensors and Actuators</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Sensors:</strong>  
      The system employs high-speed optical sensors or infrared sensor arrays that offer high-resolution, real-time positional data with minimal latency.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Actuators:</strong>  
      Precision servo motors are used to tilt the bowl. Their fast response times and precise positioning capabilities are essential for the rapid corrective actions required by the PID controller.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Benefits and Drawbacks of the Design</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefits:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Precision:</em> Dual-axis PID control allows for fine-tuned corrective actions, keeping the ball near the center.</li>
      <li><em>Real-Time Response:</em> High-speed sensor feedback and rapid actuation enable swift correction of disturbances.</li>
      <li><em>Scalability:</em> The modular design of sensors, controllers, and actuators makes it adaptable to different sizes or similar applications.</li>
      <li><em>Coolness Factor:</em> The dynamic 3D simulation and elegant control solution provide a visually impressive demonstration of advanced control systems.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Drawbacks:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Power Usage:</em> Continuous actuation by servo motors may lead to higher power consumption, especially in larger-scale systems.</li>
      <li><em>Sound Volume:</em> Mechanical components such as motors can produce noticeable noise during operation.</li>
      <li><em>Assembly Complexity:</em> Integrating high-speed sensors and precision actuators requires careful calibration and mechanical design.</li>
      <li><em>Sensitivity:</em> The system may be susceptible to external disturbances, necessitating robust filtering and error-handling mechanisms.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Collaboration Approach (If Working in a Team)</h3>
    <p>
      Although this is a personal project, if I were to collaborate with others, I would divide the work as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sensor Integration & Data Acquisition:</strong> A specialist would handle the selection, calibration, and integration of high-speed sensors to ensure accurate positional tracking.</li>
      <li><strong>Control System Development:</strong> An expert in control theory would design, implement, and fine-tune the dual-axis PID controllers for optimal performance.</li>
      <li><strong>Mechanical Design & Actuation:</strong> A mechanical engineer would develop the inverted bowl mechanism and integrate the servo motors for smooth, precise actuation.</li>
      <li><strong>Software & Simulation:</strong> A software engineer would develop and maintain the MATLAB simulation, ensuring accurate 3D visualization and numerical integration.</li>
    </ul>
